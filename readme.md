## How it works

The UI is *not* done, but here are the things that are:

- **Current frame:** Text to inform which frame you currently are on. Can be useful to navigate through the frames.

- **Frame slider:** A slider used to navigate through the frames.

- **New frame button:** A button which creates a new last frame once pressed.

- **One frame backward button:** A button to go one frame backward, used for a more precise navigation of frames.

- **Play button:** A play button which will play all the frames from start to finish once pressed. Speed is not adjustable, but will be in future version.

- **One frame forward button:** A button to go one frame forward, used for a more precise navigation of frames.

- **X-coordinate:** Text to inform which x-coordinate the pointer is on currently. Used to for more precise drawing.

- **Y-coordinate** Text to inform which y-coordinate the pointer is on currently. Used to for more precise drawing.

- **Pen button:** A button which will activate the pen, and you will now be able to draw once the canvas registers a mouse click.

- **Eraser button:** A button which will activate the eraser, and you will now be able to erase once the canvas registers a mouse click.
